Support for other tables has been added - other table formats can be specified at run time in order to convert CSV exports of other tables.

<!--truncate-->

The `--table` flag requires the table be supported by l2p. Using the `--schema` flag allows you to supply a schema file that can support any arbitrary table layout.

Added:
* new flag for the `convert` command - `--table <name>`
* new flag for the `convert` command - `--schema <file>`

Removed:
* the `version` command no longer outputs the golang version the binary was compiled with
